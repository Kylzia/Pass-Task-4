                                                <p>As the global race to produce a Covid-19 vaccine continues, China appears to have made huge strides, with vaccines from two front-runners - Sinovac and Sinopharm - already making their way abroad.Sinovac.It has been in Phase III clinical trials in Brazil, Chile, Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, and Turkey.
                                                It relies on traditional technology similar to BBIBP-CorV and BBV152, other inactivated-virus COVID-19 vaccines in Phase III trials. Sinovac does not need to be frozen, and both the vaccine and raw material for formulating the new doses could be transported and refrigerated at 2–8 °C (36–46 °F), temperatures at which flu vaccines are kept.

                                        <p>The Beijing-based biopharmaceutical company Sinovac is behind the CoronaVac, an inactivated vaccine.</p>

                                        <p>It works by using killed viral particles to expose the body's immune system to the virus without risking a serious disease response.</p>

                                        <p>By comparison the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines being developed in the West are mRNA vaccines. This means part of the coronavirus' genetic code is injected into the body, triggering the body to begin making viral proteins, but not the whole virus, which is enough to train the immune system to attack.</p>

                                        <p>"CoronaVac is a more traditional method [of vaccine] that is successfully used in many well known vaccines like rabies," Associate Prof Luo Dahai of the Nanyang Technological University told the BBC.</p>

                                        <p>"mRNA vaccines are a new type of vaccine and there is [currently] no successful example [of them] being used in the population," Prof Luo adds.</p>
